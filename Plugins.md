In this section, we'll learn about using existing plugins and briefly introduce the process of making your own plugins.

# Working with Plugins
## Using the Plugin Manager
Learn to use the Plugin Manager with [QGIS Tutorials & Tips' Using Plugins tutorial](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/using_plugins.html).

A tutorial from the [Module 10.1. Lesson: Installing and Managing Plugins](http://docs.qgis.org/2.14/en/docs/training_manual/qgis_plugins/fetching_plugins.html#basic-fa-configuring-additional-plugin-repositories) in the QGIS Training Manual covers similar topics.

## Finding Plugins
The number of plugins available for QGIS is growing.  How can you find what you're looking for?  Honestly (don't hate us for this answer) a Google search for "QGIS plugin" + the topic you're interested in is probably the best way.  From this, not only will you likely find the entry in the QGIS plugin list, but you'll find tutorials and posts related to any relevant plugins, including discussions of which option to pick if multiple options are available.  Additionally, you can search the [QGIS plugin list](http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/).

## Try Some Plugins
We've picked out some plugins that we think are pretty useful.  We'd like you to try out a few plugins, just to get an idea of what's available and how they work.  You don't need to try all of these suggestions, but pick a couple and explore.  

|Plugin|Summary|Tutorial|
|---|---|---|
|QuickMapServices|Basemaps| |
|Qgis2web|OpenLayers 3 and Leaflet webmaps from QGIS projects| |
|Spatialite| | |
|TimeManager| | |
|TableManager| | |
|Digizing| | |
|  -- Advanced Digitizing| | |
|  -- CAD Tools| | |
|  -- Numeric Edit| | |
|UAS| | |
|  -- eVis| | |
|  -- Photo2Shape| | |
|  -- GPX Velocity?| | |

## Managing Plugins
Loaded plugins take a lot of memory, which adds to the program start time, occasionally causes crashes, or rarely can cause conflicts of software versions.  For these reasons, turn off plugins that you are not using.  Given that you've just tried a bunch of new plugins it would be a good time to visit the Plugin Manager to turn off any that you don't think you'll be using on a regular basis.

# Making New Plugins
Writing your own python plugins for QGIS can easily be it's own workshop, if not a full course, so we'll just introduce the general concepts here.  We encourage you to explore this concept more if it is of interest to you.  Both of your instructors have experience with this topic, so please ask us questions if you'd like to know more.
