# Activating Tools (Advanced Interface)
In addition to the built-in [vector menu](http://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/processing/vector_menu.html) and plugins, QGIS has a [toolbox](http://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/processing/toolbox.html) that allows users to access data processing and analysis tools developed for other GIS programs such as GRASS and R.  The QGIS Training Manual has an extensive look at the [QGIS Processing Framework](http://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/processing/index.html).

*Note: Many Processing algorithms rely on external software to QGIS. If you want to use them you do need to ensure that you install and configure them. The manual discusses this under [Configuring external applications](http://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/processing/3rdParty.html)*

# Using Models
The [Graphic Modeler](http://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/processing/modeler.html) is a tool that allows users to visually design a workflow, in a way similar to the ArcGIS Model Builder.
